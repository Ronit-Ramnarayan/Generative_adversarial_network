# Generative_adversarial_network
In this project, I will be implementing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the MNIST dataset. A GAN is a generative model that takes a small input like a few numbers, for example, and produces a complex output, like an image of digits (which is what this project will be doing).
